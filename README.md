##Synopsis
A number of sample programs supplied by Carsten Flensburg which demonstrate how to use various API's. These are all code
samples originally posted to iProdeveloper as part of the Using API's articles. Some of the samples are a collection of commands
and programs which require a special build file for them to be created, the setup script will call the cbx---m.clp if found in the 
directory.

##Purpose
Provide a number of code examples which can be used as utilities on IBM i. The code demonstrates the use of a number of API's.
